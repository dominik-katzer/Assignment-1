## The TRR 266 Template for Reproducible Empirical Research 

This repository provides an infrastructure for open science oriented empirical projects. It is based on the [TREAT repository](https://github.com/trr266/treat) but uses World Bank data instead of WRDS data so that it can be used by everybody interested in reproducible empirical research. Currently, this is all R based but it is not meant to stay that way. You can help by contributing Python and/or Stata code that mimics the R analysis steps via pull requests.

This repository was built based on the ['trer' template for reproducible emprical research](https://github.com/trr266/trer). Thank you for providing it and allowing usage!

I changed a few things. I added text to the paper, changed the front page. Furthermore, I added a new page to the presentation and changed the first slide as well. Additionally, I changed the regression by using unemployment as the only independent variable and by changing year fixed-effects and clustered standard errors. However, when I tried to add a fifth model, I got the error message "LaTex failed to compile paper.tex"
